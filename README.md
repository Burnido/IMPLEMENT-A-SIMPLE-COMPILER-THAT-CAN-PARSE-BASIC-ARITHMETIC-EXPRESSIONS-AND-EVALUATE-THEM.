DESCRIPTION : This project implements a simple expression evaluator in C++ that can parse and compute the result of basic arithmetic expressions entered by the user. It mimics the behavior of a tiny compiler or interpreter, specifically designed to handle mathematical expressions involving addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), as well as parentheses (()), decimals, and operator precedence.
The core idea is to simulate a real-world parsing and evaluation mechanism â€” a foundational concept in compilers, calculators, and interpreters. The program is divided into two major components: lexical parsing and expression evaluation.
The user is prompted to input an arithmetic expression such as 3 + 4 * 2, (1 + 2) * 4.5, or even nested expressions like (2 + (3 * 4)) - (6 / 2). The parser processes the input string character-by-character, skipping whitespaces and interpreting numbers, parentheses, and operators according to standard mathematical rules.
To ensure accuracy, the program respects operator precedence. Multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction, unless overridden by parentheses. For example, the expression 3 + 4 * 2 evaluates to 11 (not 14) because multiplication takes precedence over addition.
The evaluation process is broken down into several recursive functions:
parseExpression() handles the overall expression logic, including + and -.
parseTerm() deals with higher precedence operations * and /.
parseFactor() handles parentheses and numbers.
parseNumber() converts substrings into actual floating-point numbers using stod().
Error checking is also integrated. For instance, the program throws runtime errors for:
Mismatched parentheses (e.g., (3 + 5)
Invalid characters (e.g., 3 + a)
Division by zero (4 / 0)
This project is an excellent introduction to recursive descent parsing, which is a top-down method of syntax analysis commonly used in programming language interpreters and compilers. It also demonstrates the use of standard C++ libraries like <string>, <cctype>, and <stdexcept>, along with exception handling.
Users can repeatedly enter expressions in a loop until they type "exit", making the program interactive and user-friendly.
Overall, this project provides a practical demonstration of parsing logic and arithmetic evaluation. It can be further extended to support variables, exponentiation (^), unary operators (-5), and even full-fledged abstract syntax trees (ASTs). For students and beginners, it serves as a perfect stepping stone toward understanding how compilers work and how complex expressions are processed under the hood.
